<h1>Minecraft</h1>
<p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game that uses blocks to represent the world and its components; you can think of it a lot like virtual Legos. It was created in 2009 by the programmer Notch from the Mojang company. Since then, it has sold over 200 million copies and by 2020 has over 126 million monthly active users.</p>
