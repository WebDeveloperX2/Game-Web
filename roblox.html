<h1>Roblox</h1>
<p>While it first launched back in 2006, Roblox has evolved over the recent years into one of the most popular virtual playgrounds on the planet. At its core, Roblox is a gaming platform that allows you to play dozens of user-created games or create games through Roblox Studio. From role-playing games to rhythm titles and shooters, the platform is a toy box of experiences for all ages. It doesnâ€™t hurt that Roblox also has a social media component that allows users to make friends, talk to developers of various user-created games or even join others in creating games.</p>
